**Software companies are like the sands on the seashore.** We've got staying power. We've been at it for more than 40 years now. Because we're competent, reliable, and persistent - and because we're eager to work our way into every area of expertise, and we can. One of our "_founding fathers_" sums it up thus:

**"Our breadth is our depth"**
<br>\- Dr. Jan Messerschmidt
